# Water-Jug-Puzzle-Solver

Engineered an advanced C++ program, elegantly mastering the breadth-first search and backtracking algorithms to tackle the famous
three-jug water puzzle through optimal problem-solving.

The three-jug water puzzle problem was as follows: 
Given an 8-gallon jug full of water and two empty jugs of 5- and 3-gallon capacity, get exactly 4
gallon of water in one of the jugs by completely filling up and/or emptying jugs into others. Solve
this puzzle by using breadth-first search.

By working in this project, it helped me to strategically utilize dynamic memory allocation and pointers to manage the evolving state space, ensuring efficient memory usage during the exploration of potential solutions.
